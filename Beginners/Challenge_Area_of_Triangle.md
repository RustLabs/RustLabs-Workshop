# Challenge: Find the Area of a Triangle

- Problem Statement 
The task is to call the root function `my_area` that calculates the area of a triangle.

area of a traingle = 1/2âˆ—baseâˆ—height

- A method `triangle_area()` is defined within the module shapes.
- The task is to complete the method
     - Implement root function.
     - Call the root function `my_area` from within the public function `triangle_area()`.
     -  Print the return value from the root function, i.e., area of the triangle
     
     
## Input 
```
   x and y   
```
 Note: Assume that base and height are passed to the function `my_public_function`
 
## Output 
The area of a triangle
```
 float value
```
## Sample Input 
```
   x = 3, y = 4
```
## Sample Output 
```
   6
```

## Coding Exercise

```
mod shapes{
  pub fn triangle_area(base : i32, height : i32) {
      // call the root function 'my_area' and print the return value
  }
}

```
Good luck!ðŸ¤ž
