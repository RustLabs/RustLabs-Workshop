# Integers 

Variables of Integer data type hold whole number values. There are two subtypes of integer data type in Rust, based on the number of bits occupied by a variable in memory.

# Fixed Size Types 

The fixed integer types have a specific number of bits in their notation. This notation is a combination of a letter and a number. The former denotes the category of the integer, whether it is, unsigned or signed, and the latter denotes the size of an integer, i.e., 8, 16, 32, 64.

- Below is the list of fixed length integer types:

   - i8: The 8-bit signed integer type.

   - i16: The 16-bit signed integer type.

   - i32: The 32-bit signed integer type.

    - i64: The 64-bit signed integer type.

    u8: The 8-bit unsigned integer type.

    u16: The 16-bit unsigned integer type.

    u32: The 32-bit unsigned integer type.

    u64: The 64-bit unsigned integer type.
