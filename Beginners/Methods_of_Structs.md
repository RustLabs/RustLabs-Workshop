# Methods of Structs

- What Are Methods? 

Methods are just like user-defined functions. They are like functions, but the only difference lies in the fact that methods are declared specifically 
within the struct context.

- Declare a Method 

The method is like a regular function except that the &self parameter is passed to it and the items within the function are accessed through it.

```
self.ite
```
Here self is the calling instance, i.e., it is referencing to the struct.

- Call a Method 

An instance of the struct has to be created to invoke it. This is similar to invoking a struct.
