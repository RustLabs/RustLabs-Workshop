# Returning a Value From a Function


- Returning Functions 

The functions can return a value using the return keyword inside the function definition. After the return statement is executed, the control gets back to the caller.
A function invocation is replaced with the value that the call returns. Thus, that value can be saved in a variable.

- Syntax
The function definition for returning a value from a function:

![Defining a function with explicitly defining the return value](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/return-fn-val.png)

There are two ways to actually return the value.

The general syntax for returning a value from a function using the return keyword:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/return-val.png)

The following syntax can be used to return a value from a function without using the return keyword:

Just write the return value, the compiler will interpret it because of the -> sign in the function definition.

# Example 1 

The following example makes a function `square()` that takes a number n as a parameter to the function and stores the square of n in the 
local variable m and returns the variable m.

```
fn square(n:i32)->i32{
  println!("The value of n inside function : {}", n);
  let m = n * n;
  m // return the square of the number n
}  
fn main() {
  let  n = 4;
  println!("The value of n before function call : {}", n);
  println!("Invoke Function");
  println!("\nOutput : {}",square(n));
}

```
output 
```
The value of n before function call : 4
Invoke Function
The value of n inside function : 4

Output : 16

```
# Example 2

The following example makes a function square() that takes a number n as a parameter to the function and returns the square of the number n 
by using the return keyword.

```
fn square(n:i32)->i32{
  println!("The value of n inside function : {}", n);
  return n * n;
}  
fn main() {
  let  n = 4;
  println!("The value of n before function call : {}", n);
  println!("Invoke Function");
  println!("\nOutput : {}", square(n));
}


````
output 

```
The value of n before function call : 4
Invoke Function
The value of n inside function : 4

Output : 16


```
# Explanation 
The above program is of two parts, the user defined function square() and the driver function main() where the function is being called.

- User defined function 

The function `square()` is defined from `line 1` to `line 4`.

   - On `line 3` n is multiplied with itself and the value is saved in n and value of type i32 is returned using the return keyword.

- Driver function 

The driver function `main()` is defined from `line 5` to `line 10`.
   - On `line 6`, a variable n is defined.
   - On `line 9`, the function square() is invoked which takes n as an argument to the function and the value of the square is printed using the` println!()` macro.
   
# Quiz 

Test your understanding of returning a value from a function in Rust.

1. What is the output of the following code?

```
fn main(){
   println!("Area of rectangle is {}", get_area(2, 2));
}
fn get_area(x:i32, y:i32) -> i32 {
   x  *  y
}

```
A) 4. <br>
B) 4.0 <br>
