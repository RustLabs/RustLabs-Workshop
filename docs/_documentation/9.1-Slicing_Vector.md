# Slicing a Vector

- Get Slice 
Imagine a situation where you need to get a portion of a vector. Rust allows you to borrow the slice of the vector instead of using the whole vector.

- Syntax 
Slice is a two-word object. The first word is a pointer to the data, and the second word is the length of the slice.



```
fn main() {
   // define a vector of size 5
   let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let slice:&[i32] = &my_vec[2..4];
   // print the vector
   println!("Slice of the vector : {:?}",slice);
}

```
output 

```
Slice of the vector : [3, 4]

```
