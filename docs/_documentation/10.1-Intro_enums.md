# Introduction to Enums

- What Are Enums? 
Enum is a custom data type that is composed of variants.

```
 Variants are values which are definite.

```
The key is to enumerate all possible values and select one of the values from the list.

- Let’s consider a real life example to understand the concept of enums. The traffic signal can have  
only three possible states: red, yellow and green for stop, slow down, and go respectively.

# Declare an Enum 

Enums are declared using the enum keyword followed by the name of the enum and then the body of the enum 
enclosed within curly braces `{` `}`. Within the curly braces, the variants of the enum are defined.

Naming Convention
- The name of the enum and it’s variants are written in CamelCase.


# Initialize an Enum 

Enums are initialized using the name of the enum followed by a double colon`(::)` and then specifying the name of the variant of the enum.

Note: To print the values of an enum, write `#[derive(Debug)]` at the beginning of the program code. Use the debug `trait{:?}` for printing the variants.

- Example 
The following example declares an `enum` named `KnightMoves`.

Note: To keep things simple, two variants are mentioned. However, a Knight in chess can move be in four directions. It moves to a square that is two squares 
away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally

```
// make this `enum` printable with `fmt::Debug`.

#[derive(Debug)]

enum KnightMove{

   Horizontal, Vertical

}

fn main() {

   // use enum

   let horizontal_move = KnightMove::Horizontal;

   let vertical_move = KnightMove::Vertical;

   // print the enum values

   println!("Move 1: {:?}", horizontal_move);

   println!("Move 2: {:?}", vertical_move);

}



```
output

```
Move 1: Horizontal
Move 2: Vertical

```

# Quiz 

Test your understanding of basics of enums in Rust.

1. Suppose you have defined an `enum`

```
enum Move{
  Left, Right, Top, Bottom
}

```
How would you call variant `Left` in the `main` function?

A)
```
let my_move=Move::Left;
```
B)
```
let my_move=Move:Left;
```
