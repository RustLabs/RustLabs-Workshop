# Comparison of The Different Conditional Constructs

# Use `if` Statement 

- Use an if statement if:
  - It is desired to test the truthiness of an expression
  - There is a single affirmative test
  - There is a need to evaluate different expressions for each branch
  - It can test expressions based on ranges of values or conditions
  
# Use `match` Statement 

- Use a `match` statement if:
   -  It is desired to compare multiple possible conditions of an expression
   -  The values belong to the same domain
   -  It can test expressions based on values only, i.e., condition cannot take ranges
   
# Use `if let` Statement 
- Use an if let statement if:
  - There is a pattern in the condition and it is to be matched with the scrutinee expression
