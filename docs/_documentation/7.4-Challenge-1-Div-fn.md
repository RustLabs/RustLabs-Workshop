# Challenge 1: Check Divisibility by 3 and 4

- Problem Statement 

Write a function `test_divisibility_by_3_4 `which will check whether a given integer number is divisible by `3` or `4`.
  - If the number is divisible by both return 0
  - If the number is divisible by 3 only return 1
  - If the number is divisible by 4 only return 2
  - If the number is not divisible by both, return -1
  
- Input 
```

```
Sample Input 
```
    12 , 9 , 16 , 19
```
Sample Output 
```
    0 , 1 , 2 , -1
```

Coding Exercise 

```
fn test_divisibility_by_3_4(a:i32) -> i32{
    // Write code here
    -10
}

```
