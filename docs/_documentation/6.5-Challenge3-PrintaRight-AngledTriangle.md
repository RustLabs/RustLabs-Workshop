# Challenge 3 - Print a Right-Angled Triangle


# Problem Statement 
- Write a code which prints a right-angled triangle of the character `&`.

The code takes an integer variable row as input and prints the right-angled triangle with that number of rows displaying `&`.

The base of the right-angled triangle is the input number, i.e., input of n will yield a triangle of base n

Input

```
 positive integer
 
```
Output

```
 right-angled triangle
 
```
Sample Input 

```
   5
```

Sample Output

```
   &
   &&
   &&&
   &&&&
   &&&&&
   
```

# Coding Exercise 

```
fn test(n:i32) {
 // Write code here!
}
```

Good luck! 🤞
