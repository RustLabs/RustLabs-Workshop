# Integers 

Variables of Integer data type hold whole number values. There are two subtypes of integer data type in Rust, based on the number of bits occupied by a variable in memory.

# Fixed Size Types 

The fixed integer types have a specific number of bits in their notation. This notation is a combination of a letter and a number. The former denotes the category of the integer, whether it is, unsigned or signed, and the latter denotes the size of an integer, i.e., 8, 16, 32, 64.

- Below is the list of fixed length integer types:

   - i8: The 8-bit signed integer type.

   - i16: The 16-bit signed integer type.

   - i32: The 32-bit signed integer type.

   - i64: The 64-bit signed integer type.

   - u8: The 8-bit unsigned integer type.

   - u16: The 16-bit unsigned integer type.

   - u32: The 32-bit unsigned integer type.

   - u64: The 64-bit unsigned integer type.

# Variable Size Types 

The integer type in which the particular size depends on the underlying machine architecture.

💡 Why are there so many types of integers and how do you pick a data type?
The choice depends on what values a variable is expected to hold. So, a programmer should pick a data type that is not so small that the data is lost. Nor should they pick a data type that is so big that it wastes memory.


isize: The pointer-sized signed integer type.
usize: The pointer-sized unsigned integer type


# Example 

The code below defines an integer type both explicitly and implicitly:

- Explicit Definition 

The following code explicitly defines the integer variables using the integer type fixed or variable):

```

fn main() {
    //explicitly define an integer
    let a:i32 = 24;
    let b:u64 = 23;
    let c:usize = 26;
    let d:isize = 29;
    //print the values
    println!("a: {}", a);
    println!("b: {}", b);
    println!("c: {}", c);
    println!("d: {}", d);
    
}

```

Output
```
a: 24
b: 23
c: 26
d: 29

```

# Implicit Definition 

The following code implicitly defines the integer type of the variable by assigning an integer value to the variable.

```

fn main() {
    //explicitly define an integer
    let a = 21; 
    let b = 1;
    let c = 54;
    let d = 343434;
    //print the variable
    println!("a: {}", a);
    println!("b: {}", b);
    println!("c: {}", c);
    println!("d: {}", d);
    
}

```
Output
```
a: 21
b: 1
c: 54
d: 343434

```


# Floating Point

Floating-point numbers refer to numbers with a fractional part.

The representation of floating-point numbers in a computer’s memory is such that the precision with which a number is stored in memory depends on the number of bits used for storing the variable.

In this respect, there are two subtypes: single-precision f32 and double-precision f64 floating-point, with the latter having more bits to store the number.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/f-size.png)

- f32: The 32-bit floating point type.
- f64: The 64-bit floating point type.


# Example 

The code below defines a floating-point number both explicitly and implicitly:
- Explicit Definition 

The following code explicitly defines the float variable using the float type (f32 or f64)

```
fn main() {
    //explicitly define a float type
    let f1:f32 = 32.9;
    let f2:f64 = 6789.89;
    println!("f1: {}", f1);
    println!("f2: {}", f2);
}


```

Output
```
f1: 32.9
f2: 6789.89
```

# Implicit Definition

The following code implicitly defines the float type of the variable by assigning a floating-point value to the variable:

```
fn main() {
    //implicitly define a float type
    let pi = 3.14;
    let e = 2.17828;
    println!("pi: {}", pi);
    println!("e: {}", e);
}

```
Output
```
pi: 3.14
e: 2.17828
```
