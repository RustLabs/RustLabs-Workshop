# Solution - Resizing a Vector

```
fn test(my_vec: &mut Vec<u32>)-> &mut Vec<u32>{
   let middle = (my_vec.len())/2;
   my_vec.pop(); 
   my_vec.remove(middle - 1);
   let mut sum : u32 = 0;
   for v in my_vec.iter()
   {
      sum = sum + v;
   }
   my_vec.push(sum);
   my_vec
}
fn main(){
    let mut v1 = vec![1, 5, 7, 9];
    println!("Original Vector: {:?}", v1);
    println!("Updated Vector: {:?}", test(&mut v1));
    let mut v2 = vec![1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6];
    println!("Original Vector: {:?}", v2);
    println!("Updated Vector: {:?}", test(&mut v2));
}



```

output 

```
Original Vector: [1, 5, 7, 9]
Updated Vector: [1, 7, 8]
Original Vector: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6]
Updated Vector: [1, 2, 1, 2, 6]

```

# Explanation #

- A function test is declared with` my_vec` of type `u32` passed to it as a parameter.
   -  On `line 2`, a number is removed from the last index using pop function, so the `number 9` (the last element) gets removed.
   -  On `line 3`, a number is removed at position 1 using the remove function, so the `number 5` (the middle element) gets removed.
   -  On `line 4`, a mutable variable sum is initialized to 0.
   -  On `line 5`, a variable sum stores the summation of elements of the vector by iterating using a for loop over the vector using my_vec.iter()
   -  On `line 6`, a sum is added to the last index of my_vec using push function.
   -  On `line 7`, myvec is returned.

Now that you have learned about vectors, what if you want to group variables having some similarity to be placed under one name in a block of memory, let’s learn about “structs”
