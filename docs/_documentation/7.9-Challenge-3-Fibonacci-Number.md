# Challenge 3: Find nth Fibonacci Number

- Problem Statement 

In this exercise, you have to write a recursive function fibonacci that takes a positive integer number n as a parameter 
and returns the nth Fibonacci term in that range.

   - The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers in which the next term is found by adding the two previous terms:
   
 ```  
 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
 ```
 Here , the number 1 is the first term, 1 is the second term, 2 is the third term and so on…
 
 Input
 
 ```
   an integer n
 ```
 Output 
 
 ```
   nth fibonacci term
 ```
 Sample Input
 ```
 7
 ```
 Sample Output 
 
 ```
 13
 ```
 
# Coding Exercise 

```
fn fibonacci(term: i32) -> i32 {

    // Write code here

    -1

}


```

Good luck! 🤞
