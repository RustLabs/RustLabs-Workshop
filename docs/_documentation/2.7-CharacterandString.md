# Character and String

- Character 

The variable is used to store a single character value, such as a single digit or a single alphabet. The value assigned to a char variable is enclosed in a single quote('') .

Note: Unlike some other languages, a character in Rust takes up 4 bytes rather than a single byte. It does so because it can store a lot more than just an ASCII value like emojis, Korean, Chinese, 
and Japanese characters.

# Example 

The code below defines a character both explicitly and implicitly:

- Explicit Definition 

The following code explicitly defines the variable using the char keyword:

```
fn main() {
    // explicitly define 
    let char_1:char = 'e';
    println!("character1: {}", char_1); 
}

```

Output

```
character1: e
```

Implicit Definition 

The following code implicitly defines the character type of the variable by assigning the single value enclosed within single quotes to them.

```
fn main() { 
    // implicitly define
    let char_2 = 'a';
    let char_3 = 'b';
    println!("character2: {}", char_2);
    println!("character3: {}", char_3);
}

```

Output

```
character2: a
character3: b

```

# String 

A string is any sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes (" ").

# Example 

The code below defines a string both explicitly and implicitly:

- Explicit Definition 

The following code explicitly defines the variable using the `&str` keyword:

```
fn main() {
    // explicitly define 
    let str_1:&str = "Rust Programming";
    println!("String 1: {}", str_1); 
}

```

Output

```
String 1: Rust Programming

```

# Implicit Definition 

The following code implicitly defines the string type of the variable by assigning the single value enclosed within double quotes to them.
```

fn main() { 
    // implicitly define
    let str_2 = "Rust Programming";
    println!("String 2: {}", str_2);
}


```
output:- 
```
String 2: Rust Programming

```

# Quiz 

1. What is the output of the following code? <br>

```

let value:str = "Rust Programming";
println!("{}", value);

```
a) Rust Programming <b> 
b) Error <br> 

2. What is the valid syntax for defining a character explicitly? <br>

a) ``` let char1 : char = 'e'; ```    <br> 
b) ``` let char1: character = 'e'; ```  <br>
