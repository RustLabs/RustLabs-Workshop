# Challenge 2: Make a Calculator

# Problem Statement 

- Write a code which will take:
  - Two variables named `a` and `b`
  - a character type variable called operator which will take operators `(+,-,/,*,%)` will be passed as input to our match statement
  - Use match statements to compute: addition of `a` and `b`, subtraction of `b` from `a`, multiplication of a and b, division of a by` b`, modulus of` a` by `b`
  
# Sample Input 
Suppose three inputs are given:

```
a = 3,  b = 2,  operator = '+' 
a = 3 , b = 2,  operator = '(' 
a = 3 , b = 0,  operator = '/' 
```
# Sample Output 
The output of the program corresponding to input:

```
5
invalid operator
Division by 0 is undefined
```

# Coding Exercise 

It is recommended​ that you try solving the exercise yourself before viewing the solution.

Important Note: In the code below you only have to write the match construct. Assume that _a is the first number, _operator is the operator and _b is the second number.

For any invalid operator passed as input the program should print invalid


```
fn test(a: i32, operator: char, b: i32) {
   // Write code here
}

```
Good luck!🤞
