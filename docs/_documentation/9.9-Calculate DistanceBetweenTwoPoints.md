# Challenge - Calculate Distance Between Two Points

Problem Statement

  -  A struct Point is given which has two items, `x` and `y`.
  - The function test is given which has two instances of points initialized with some value of `x` and `y`.
  - The task is to calculate the distance between the two points.
  
 The distance between two points is:  âˆšâ€‹(x1âˆ’x2)â€‹2â€‹â€‹+(y1âˆ’y2)â€‹2â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
  
 
- Return the value of distance

input 
```
Two instances of point
```
Output
The output of the code should be:
```
  The distance between x and y

```
# Coding Exercise 

```
struct Point {
	x: i32,
	y: i32
}
fn test(_point1: Point, _point2: Point)-> f32 {
	// Write code here!
    1.0
}



```

Good luck! ðŸ¤ž
