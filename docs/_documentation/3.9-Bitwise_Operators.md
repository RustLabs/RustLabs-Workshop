# Bitwise Operators

- What Are Bitwise Operators? 
Bitwise operators deal with the binary representation of the operands.

# Types 
The table below summarizes the types of bitwise operators in Rust.


| operator  	| operation  	| explanation 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| operand1 & operand2 	| AND 	| <br>bitwise AND operand1 and operand2 	|
| operand1 \| operand2  	| OR 	| bitwise OR operand1 and operand2 	|
| operand1 ^ operand2   	| XOR 	| bitwise XOR operand1 and operand2 	|
|     ! operand1  	| NOT 	| Inverse the bit of operand  	|
| << operand  	| Left shift 	| moves all the operand1 to the left by the number of places specified in the operand 2 <br>new bits filled with zeros . shifting a value left by one position is equivalent to multiplying it by 2 ,<br>Shifting to positions is equivalent to multiplying it by 4 and so on  	|
| >> operand  	| Right Shift  	| moves all the operand1 to the right by the number of places specified in the operand 2 <br>new bits filled with zeros . shifting a value right by one position is equivalent to multiplying it by 2 ,<br>Shifting to positions is equivalent to multiplying it by 4 and so on 	|


📝 Note: Right shift >> is same as arithmetic right shift on signed integer types, logical right shift on unsigned integer types.

# Example 

The example below shows the bitwise AND, OR, XOR, Left Shift, and Right Shift operations.

The following example shows the use of bitwise operators in a program:

```
fn main() {
  let a = 5;
  let b = 6;
  println!("Operand 1: {}, Operand 2: {}", a , b);
  println!("AND: {}", a & b);
  println!("OR: {}", a | b);
  println!("XOR: {}", a ^ b);
  println!("NOT a: {}", !a);
  println!("Left shift: {}", a << 2);
  println!("Right shift: {}", a >> 1);


}

```
output :- 
```

Operand 1: 5, Operand 2: 6
AND: 4
OR: 7
XOR: 3
NOT a: -6
Left shift: 20
Right shift: 2

```


# Quiz 

What is the output of the following code?
```
fn main() {
  let mut a = 1;
  let mut b = 2;
  a = a & b;
  a = a << 1;
  b = b >> 3;
  println!("a: {}", a);
  println!("b: {}", b); 
}

```

A) a: 0 <br>
   b: 2  <br>
   
B) a: 0  <br>
   b: 0  <br>

C) a: 2  <br>
   b: 0  <br>
   
D) a: 2  <br>
   b: 2  <br>
