# Loop Labels

- What Is a Loop Label? 
 A loop label assigns an identifier to a loop.
 
- Syntax 
Write a label and colon before the loop.

- Example 
The code below prints the multiplication table of 1 to 5 except 3. See how specifying a loop label helps you to skip the table of 3.

```
fn main() {
 'outer:for i in 1..5 { //outer loop
    println!("Muliplication Table : {}", i);
   'inner:for j in 1..5 { // inner loop
        if i == 3 { continue 'outer; } // Continues the loop over `i`.
        if j == 2 { continue 'inner; } // Continues the loop over `j`.
        println!("{} * {} = {}", i, j, i * j);
   }
 }
}

```

output:

```
Muliplication Table : 1
1 * 1 = 1
1 * 3 = 3
1 * 4 = 4
Muliplication Table : 2
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 3 = 6
2 * 4 = 8
Muliplication Table : 3
Muliplication Table : 4
4 * 1 = 4
4 * 3 = 12
4 * 4 = 16

```

# Explanation 

- Outer for Loop
  -  A for loop is defined on line `2`.
  -  The loop has a label outer . It takes i as an iterator that iterates over values from `1 `to `4`.

- Inner for Loop
  -  A for loop is defined on line `3`
  - The loop has a label inner. It takes j as an iterator that iterates over values from `1` to `5`.
  -  For each i the inner loop iterate j times and prints the product `i * j`.
  -  When the outer loop increments `i` to `3` and the inner loop starts from j = 1, the condition` i == 3` is found to be true and the continue â€˜outer statement causes execution to be transferred to the next iteration of the outer loop on line `2`. The variable `i `is incremented to `4` and the execution continues.
  - When the value of j increments to `2`, then the 2nd iteration of the inner loop gets skipped and continue 'inner causes the execution to be transferred to the next iteration of the inner loop on line `4`. The variable j is incremented to `3 `and the execution continues.
