# Introduction to Operators

# Operators
- An operator is a symbol that takes one or more values and outputs another. It tells the compiler to perform some sort of operation.


# Types of Operators 
- Different operators are available in Rust for performing different operations. Based on the number of operands, the operators can be categorized into binary 
and unary operators:

# Unary Operators
- The operators that act upon a single operand are unary operators.
