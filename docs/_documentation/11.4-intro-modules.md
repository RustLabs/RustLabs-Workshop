# Introduction to Modules

- What Are Modules? 
  - Modules are a collection of items that can contain structs, functions, enums, vectors, arrays, etc.

💡Why make a module?
- As a result of making modules,
  - the program code becomes organized.
  - you can use the same name for things like a struct. For example, you can use the name Configuration in different modules and code it differently.
  Otherwise, you would have different clumsy names for the struct like EngineConfiguration, ConsoleConfiguration etc.
  
# Declare a Module 

To declare a module in Rust use the mod keyword followed by the name of the module and the body of the module within curly braces `{ }`.

- Naming Convention
  - Name of the module should be written in snake_case.

# Invoking a Module 

The module can be invoked from anywhere within the program code.

# Keywords for Modules 

- The following keywords are used for declaring modules:
   - mod - declares a new module
   - pub - makes a public module
   - use - imports the module in the local scope
   
Note: Modules are declared by the mod keyword and are private by default.

# Example 

The following example makes use of the mod keyword to declare a module named r, and defines a function `print_statement` within the module:

```
// declare a module

mod r {

  fn print_statement(){

    println!("Hi, this a function of module r");

  }

}

// main function

fn main() {

  // invoke a module 'r'

   r::print_statement();

}


```

 The above code generates an error, ❌, because the function print_statement is private
