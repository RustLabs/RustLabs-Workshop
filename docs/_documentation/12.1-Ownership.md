# Ownership

- What Is Ownership? 
    - Ownership in simple terms means to have possession of something.
    - Let’s look at a real-life analogy to explain this concept. If something belongs to you, you say “It’s mine”.

    - Similarly, in Rust, variable bindings can have ownership of what they are bound to.
    
    
    
# Three Rules of Ownership 
The following are three rules of ownership:

## Rule 1 

Each value has a variable binding called its owner.

## Rule 2 

There can only be one owner at a time.

## Rule 3 

- When an owner goes out of scope, it does not remain accessible.
    -  When the variable goes out of scope, Rust calls function drop automatically at the closing curly bracket (to deallocate the memory).

 ```
 fn main() {

  let a = 1; // variable a is the owner of the value 1

  let b = 1; // variable b is the owner of the value 1

  let c = 3; // variable c is the owner of the value 3

  

  println!("a : {}", a);

  println!("b : {}", b);

  println!("c : {}", c);

}// value a, b, c are out of scope outside this block
 
 ```
 output 
 
 ```
a : 1
b : 1
c : 3
 
 ```
 
- When using the assignment, two situations happen:
   - The value gets copied
   - The value gets moved
