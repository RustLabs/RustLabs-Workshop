# Functions With Arrays as Arguments
It is often necessary to pass arrays as arguments to functions. Rust allows the programmer to pass arrays either by value or by reference.

- Pass by Value  <br> 
   Arrays can be passed to a function by value. What that means is that a copy of the array from the calling function is made to the called function.
The general syntax for passing an array by value to a function is:

```
fn function_name( mut array_name:[datatype;size])

```
- Example 1 

The following example takes the array arr by value in the function parameter.

```
fn main() {
   let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   modify_my_array(arr);
   println!("Array in Driver Function : {:?}", arr);
}
fn modify_my_array(mut arr:[i32;5]){
   arr[2] = 8;
   arr[3] = 9;
   println!("Array in my Function : {:?}", arr);
}

```
output 

```
Array in my Function : [1, 2, 8, 9, 5]
Array in Driver Function : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

Note: The `mut` keyword when passing an array by value is optional. It is written along with the array name if it is desired to make local changes. 
It can be omitted otherwise.

# Example 2 

The following example makes a function `calculate_mean` which calculates the mean of values in an array by first taking a summation inside a for 
loop and then dividing the result by 5.

```
fn main() {
   let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   println!("Array in Driver Function : {:?}", arr);
   calculate_mean(arr);
}
fn calculate_mean(arr:[i32;5]){
   let mut sum = 0;
   for i in 0..5 {
       sum += arr[i];
   }
   println!("Mean of array values: {}", sum/5);
}

```

output 

```
Array in Driver Function : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Mean of array values: 3

```

# Pass by Reference 

Arrays can be passed by reference in the function parameter. In other words, changes are made in the original array and no copy is made when
passed by reference in the function.

The general syntax for passing an array by reference to a function is:

```
fn function_name(array_name:&mut [datatype;size])
```
- Example 

The following example takes the array arr by reference in the function parameter.

```
fn main() {
   let mut arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   modify_my_array(&mut arr);
   println!("Array in Driver Function : {:?}", arr);
}
fn modify_my_array(arr:&mut [i32;5]){
   arr[2] = 8;
   arr[3] = 9;
   println!("Array in my Function : {:?}", arr);
}

```
output 

```
Array in my Function : [1, 2, 8, 9, 5]
Array in Driver Function : [1, 2, 8, 9, 5]

```
# Return an Array 

Arrays can be returned from the function.

The general syntax for returning an array from a function is:

```
fn function_name()->[datatype;size]

```
Note: Here the parameters can also be passed.

# Example 

The following example takes the array arr, modifies it within the function and returns it.

```
fn main() {
   let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   modify_my_array(arr);
   println!("Array in Driver Function : {:?}", arr);
   println!("Array after Function Call : {:?}", modify_my_array(arr));
}
fn modify_my_array(mut arr:[i32;5])->[i32;5]{
   arr[2] = 8;
   arr[3] = 9;
   arr
}

```
output 

```
Array in Driver Function : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Array after Function Call : [1, 2, 8, 9, 5]

```
