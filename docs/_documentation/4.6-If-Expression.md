# If Expression

There can be multiple conditional constructs using an if statement.

  -  If expression

   - If…else expression

   -  If…else if…else expression

   -  Nested if expression

   -  Shorthand if expression

Let’s discuss each one of them in detail:-

# If Expression 

If expression takes a condition. If the condition within the if expression evaluates to be true, then the block of code is executed.

- Syntax 
The general syntax is:

# Illustration

The following flow chart explains the concept of an if statement:

```
fn main() {
      //define a variable  
      let learn_language = "Rust";
      // if construct 
      if learn_language == "Rust" { 
         println!("You are learning Rust language!");
      }
}



```

output:- 

```
You are learning Rust language!
```

# If…else Expression

In an `if..else` construct, if the condition within the if expression evaluates to be false, then the statement within the else block is executed.

- Syntax 

The general syntax is:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/if-else-condi.png)


# Illustration 

The following flow chart explains the concept of an if..else statement:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/if-else-flow.png)


```
fn main() {
    //define a variable 
    let learn_language = "Rust";
    // if else construct 
    if learn_language == "Rust" { 
        println!("You are learning Rust language!");
    }
    else {
      println!("You are learning some other language!");
    } 
}

```
Output
```
You are learning Rust language!
```

# if…else if…else Expression

If there are multiple conditions to be checked, then if..else if..else construct is used.

Syntax 
The general syntax is:

# llustration 
The following flow chart explains the concept of an if..else if..else expression:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/if-else-if-else-flow.png)


```
fn main() {
      //define a variable 
      let learn_language="Rust";
      // if..elseif..else construct 
      if learn_language == "Rust" { 
         println!("You are learning Rust language!");
      }
      else if learn_language == "Java" { 
         println!("You are learning Java language!");
      }
      else {
         println!("You are learning some other language!");
      } 
}



```
Output
```
You are learning Rust language!

```

# Nested if Expression 
An if expression inside the body of another if expression is referred to as a nested if expression.
- Syntax 
An if construct is enclosed within an if construct.
The general syntax is:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/nested-if.png)

Note: The nested if expression can also be written with a AND expression in an if.
```
if condition1 && condition2 
{
 //statement
}

```
This is true only if the second if statement is the only thing inside the first if.

# Illustration

The following flow chart explains the concept of a nested if statement .

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/nested-if-flow.png)


Note: There can be as many levels of nesting as you want.

```
fn main() {
    //define a variable 
    let learn_language1 = "Rust";
    let learn_language2 = "Java";
    // outer if statement
    if learn_language1 == "Rust" {  // inner if statement
        if learn_language2 == "Java"{
              println!("You are learning Rust and Java language!");
        }
    }
    else {
      println!("You are learning some other language!");
    } 
}


```

output:-

```
You are learning Rust and Java language!

```

# Shorthand if 
Instead of writing a lengthy if-else construct, we can use a shorthand if.

Syntax 
The general syntax is:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/short-if.png)

 Note: This is similar to a ternary operator in languages like C and C++.
 
 ```
 fn main() {
    //define a variable  
    let learn_language = "Rust";
    // short hand construct
    let res= if learn_language == "Rust" {"You are learning Rust language!"} else {"You are learning some other language!"};
    println!("{}", res);
}
 
 
 ```
  Note: Expressions can return a value, unlike statements. Recall that the semicolon turns any expression into a statement. It throws away its value and returns a unit () instead.

```
fn main() {
    let x = "Rust";

    let y: bool = if x == "Rust" { true } else { false };

    // let z: bool = if x == "Rust" { true; } else { false; };

    println!("x:{}", x);
    println!("y:{}", y);

}

```
Note: Uncommenting line 6 in the above code gives an error ❌ since we are trying to convert an expression to a statement and hence not returning a value.

# Quiz 

Test your understanding of if expressions in Rust.

1. What is the output of the following code?

```
fn main() {
   let age=23; 
   if age >=21{ 
      println!("Age is greater than 21");
   }
    else if age <21{
       println!("Age is less than 21");
    }
    println!("Value Printed");
}

```
A) Age is greater than 21 <br>
   Value Printed
   
B) Age is less than 21 <br>
   Value Printed
   
C) Age is greater than 21 <br>
D) Age is less than 21 <br>



2. Which If block is executed? <br>

```
fn main() {
   let age=23; 
   let play=true; 
   let activity="Tennis" ;
   if age >=21 && play==false && activity=="Tennis"{ 
     println!("Age is greater than 21");
     println!("You are not allowed to play");
     println!("The sport is {}",activity);
   }
   else if  age >=21 && play==true && activity=="Tennis"{ 
     println!("Age is greater than 21");
     println!("You are allowed to play");
     println!("The sport is {}",activity);
   }
   else if age <21 && play==false && activity=="Tennis"{
     println!("Age is less than 21");
     println!("You are allowed to play");
     println!("The sport is {}",activity);
   }
   else {
     println!("Value Printed");
   }
}


```

A) First <br>
B) Second <br>
C) Third <br>


3. What is the output of the following code? <br>

```
fn main() {
  let age = 23; 
  let play = true; 
  let activity="Baseball" ;
  if age >= 21 && play==true || activity == "Tennis" { 
    println!("Age is greater than 21");
    println!("You are allowed to play");
    println!("The sport is {}",activity);
  }
  else if  age >= 21 && play == true && activity == "Tennis"{ 
    println!("Age is greater than 21");
    println!("You are allowed to play");
    println!("The sport is {}",activity);
  }
  else if age <21 && play == false && activity == "Tennis"{
    println!("Age is less than 21");
    println!("You are allowed to play");
    println!("The sport is {}",activity);
  }
  else{
    println!("Value Printed");
  }
 }

```

A) Age is greater than 21 <br>
You are allowed to play <br>
The sport is Baseball <br>

B)Age is greater than 21 <br>
You are allowed to play <br>
The sport is Tennis <br>
