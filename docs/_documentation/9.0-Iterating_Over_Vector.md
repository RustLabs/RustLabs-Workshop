# Iterating Over a Vector

If it is desired to access each element of a vector, then it is possible to iterate over the elements of a vector using `iter()` rather than using the indexes 
to access a particular element of a vector using the square bracket notation

# Iterate Using `.iter()` Built-in Method 

- we learned to remove an element given an index. However, to remove a particular element, we first need to find the index 
of that element and then call the remove function passing that index. 

- For this we can use the `.iter().position(|&e| e == element_name).unwrap()`.


Here, <br> 

   - `iter()` is the built-in function that iterates over the elements of the vector.

   - `.position` is a built-in function that takes the element name to get the position of that element in the vector, i.e., `(|&e| e == element_name)` defines a variable e with the value equal to the name of the element that we want to find.

   - `.unwrap()` is the built-in function.
   
   
```   
fn main() {
    // defines a mutable vector
    let mut my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    // define the value to be removed
    let value = 2; 
    // get the index of the value in the vector
    let index = my_vec.iter().position(|&r| r == value).unwrap();
    // call the built-in remove method
    my_vec.remove(index);
    // print the updated vector
    println!("Updated Vector: {:?}", my_vec);
}

```
output 

```
Updated Vector: [1, 3, 4, 5]

```

As you can see the value 2 is removed from the vector.
you’ll learn how the iterator function helps to loop through each element in the vector index-by-index.
   
# Loop Through the Values 
   - Define a vector variable.
   - The values of the vector within the loop can be traversed using `.iter()`.
  
  📝If you don’t write `.iter()` within the loop defination, a simple for loop will give you the same result.
  
  
  ```
 
  fn main() {
    // define a vector of size 5   
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    // using loop
    let mut index = 0;
    for i in my_vec.iter(){ // it works even if .iter() is not written
        println!("Element at index {}:{} ", index, i);
        index = index + 1;
    }
}
  
  
  ```
  output 
  
  ```
  Element at index 0:1 
Element at index 1:2 
Element at index 2:3 
Element at index 3:4 
Element at index 4:5 
  
 
  ```
  
# Loops and Mutate Values 
  - Define a mutable vector variable
  - The values of the vector within the loop can be changed using `.iter_mut()`.
  
  
  ```
  fn main() {
   // define a vector of size 5
   let mut my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   println!("Initial Vector : {:?}", my_vec);
   for x in my_vec.iter_mut(){
       *x *= 3;
   }
   // print the updated vector
   println!("Updated Vector : {:?}", my_vec);
}
  
  ```
  
  The following illustration shows how the above code works:

 # Quiz 

Test your understanding of looping through a vector in Rust.

1. What is the output of the following code?

```
fn main() {
   let mut my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   for x in my_vec.iter_mut(){
       *x += 4;
   }
   my_vec.push(23); 
   println!("Vector : {:?}",my_vec);
   println!("Length of the vector : {}",my_vec.len());
}


```

A) 

```
Vector : [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 23]

Length of the vector : 5

```
B)

```
Vector : [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 23]

Length of the vector : 6

```
