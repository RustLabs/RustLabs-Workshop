# Functions With Parameters
In the previous example, a function was defined with nothing inside the round brackets. But certain functions require some information on which they should operate. For instance, a function that is expected to compute the square of a number 
needs to be provided with the number itself. That’s what a parameter is.

# What Are the Parameters? 
Variable or values that go in the function definition are parameters.

# What Are Arguments? 
Variables or values that go in their place in the function invocation are known as arguments.

# Example 

To understand the above concept, let’s look at the example below:

```
//function definition
fn my_func(param_1:i32, param_2:i32) {
  println!("The first value passed inside function : {}", param_1);
  println!("The second value passed inside function : {}", param_2);
}
fn main() {
  let value_1 = 1;
  let value_2 = 2;
  //calling the function
  my_func( value_1, value_2 );
  println!("Function ended");
}

```
output 

```
The first value passed inside function : 1
The second value passed inside function : 2
Function ended

```

# Explanation

The above program comprises two functions, the user defined function my_func() and the driver function main() where the function is being called.

- User defined function 

The function `my_func()` is defined from line `2` to line `5`.
 - Two parameters `param_1` and `param_2 `are passed to the function.
 -  The values of passed parameters are printed on line `3` and line `4`.

- Driver function 
- The driver `function main()` is defined from line `6` to line `12`.
  - On line `7` and line `8`, two `variables value_1` and `value_2` are defined.
  - On line `10`, the function is invoked while passing the value of the `variable value_1 `as the first argument and that of `value_2` as the second.
  
# Types of Arguments 
- Arguments can be passed to a function in two different ways:
   - Pass by value
   - Pass by reference

Test your understanding of parameterized functions in Rust!

1. What is the output of the following code?

```
fn my_func(param1:i32, param2:i32) {
  println!("The first value passed inside function : {}",  param1);
}
fn main() {
  let value1 = 1;
  let value2 = 2;
  my_func(value1, value2);
}

```
A) The first value passed inside function : 1 <br>
The second value passed inside function : 2 <br>
B)The first value passed inside function : 1 <br>
