# Challenge: Calculate (a + b)^3


Problem Statement #

The task is to compute `(a+b)3(a + b)^3(a+b)â€‹3â€‹â€‹ `and display it on the console. The following mathematical formula is expanded as:

`(a+b)â€‹3â€‹â€‹=aâ€‹3â€‹â€‹+bâ€‹3â€‹â€‹+3ab(a+b)`


# Sample Input 

```

a = 2
b = 2

```

Output 
```
64

```

# Coding Exercise

 It is recommendedâ€‹ that you try solving the exercise yourself before viewing the solution.
 
 Important Note: The power of xyx^yxâ€‹yâ€‹â€‹ is calculated as datatype :: pow(x,y). Here, the data type is the return value of the power function.
 
 ```
 fn test() {
    let a = 2;
    let b = 2;
    // Write code here!
}
```

Good luck!ðŸ¤ž
