# What Are Constant Variables? 

- Constant variables are ones that are declared constant throughout the program scope, meaning, their value cannot be modified. They can be defined 
in global and local scope.

# Syntax 
- They are declared using the `const` keyword followed by the name of the variable, colon `(:)`, and then the data type of the variable.

- Naming Convention: By convention, you write a constant variable name in a SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, i.e.,
     - All letters should be UPPER case.
     - All words should be separated using an underscore `( _ )`.
     
# Example
The following example defines two const variables:
   - ID_1 in global scope
   - ID_2 in local scope
   
   
   
 ```
   const ID_1: i32 = 4; // define a global constant variable
fn main() {
    const ID_2: u32 = 3; // define a local constant variable
    println!("ID:{}", ID_1); // print the global constant variable
    println!("ID:{}", ID_2); // print the local constant variable
}
   
 ```
 
output:
 ```
ID:4
ID:3

```

# Difference Between const and let Variables

There are many differences between const and let variables.

- Declaration 
    - Constant variables are declared using the const keyword unlike let variables.

- Scope
    - const variables are declared in global and local scope unlike let variables that are declared only in the local scope.

- Mutability
    - const variable cannot be mutable unlike let which can be made mutable using mut keyword.

- Data Type 
  -  Unlike let variables, it is mandatory to define the data type of const variables.

- Set Value at Run-time 
  - The value of const variable can only be set before running the program whereas the let variable can store the result at runtime.

- Shadowing 
  -  Unlike let variables, const variables cannot be shadowed.
