# Iterating Over Strings
The following methods describe three different ways of traversing a String:

- Tokenizing a String Object 
A String object can be tokenized on whitespace or a character token.

# Tokenizing to Separate on Whitespaces 

`split_whitespace` is used to split a String on the occurrence of whitespace. Loop through the String to split on whitespaces using a for loop.

Syntax 

The general syntax is:

```
for found in  str.split_whitespace(){
    println!("{}", found);
}

```
Here str is the original String which is to be traversed, `split_whitespace()` is a built-in keyword to split a string on whitespaces, for is used to traverse over the String and print
it as soon as the whitespace is found and found is an iterator over the String.

```
fn main() {
  // define a String object
  let str = String::from("Rust Programming"); 
  // split on whitespace
  for token in str.split_whitespace(){
      println!("{}", token);
  }
}
```
output
```
Rust
Programming
```

# Tokenizing to Split on a Custom Character 
split method is used to split a sentence on some token. The token is specified in the split method. This would be useful to 
process comma-separated data, which is a common programming task.

- Syntax 

The general syntax is:

```
for found in str.split(","){
    println!("{}", found);
}

```

Here str is the original String which is to be traversed,str.split() is a built-in method which takes a parameter,
i.e., any delimiter and split the sentence on that parameter, for is used to traverse over the String and print a word before the token.

```
fn main() {
  // define a String object
  let str = String::from("Educative, course on, Rust, Programming");  
  // split on token
  for token in str.split(","){
      println!("{}", token);
  }
}

```
output 

```
Educative
 course on
 Rust
 Programming

```

# Iterating Over the String Object 

chars method allows iterating over each element in a String using a for loop.
- Syntax 
The general syntax is:

```
for found in  str.chars(){
    println!("{}", found);
}

```

Here str is the original String which is to be traversed, `str.chars()` is a built-in keyword to denote letters in a String, 
for is used to traverse over the String and print every literal, and found is an iterator over the String.

```
fn main() {
  // define a String object
  let str = String::from("Rust Programming");  
  // split on literal
  for token in str.chars(){
      println!("{}", token);
  }
}

```

output 

```
R
u
s
t
 
P
r
o
g
r
a
m
m
i
n
g

```

# Quiz 

Test your understanding on looping through the String object.

1. What is the output of the following code? <b> 

```
fn main() {
    // define a String object
    let str = String::from("Educative, course on, Rust; Programming");  
    // split on token
    for token in str.split(";") {
        println!("{}", token);
    }
}


```

A)

```

Educative, course on, Rust

Programming

```

B)

```
Educative

course on

Rust

Programming

```
