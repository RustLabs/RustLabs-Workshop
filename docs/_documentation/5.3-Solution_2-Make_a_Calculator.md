# Explanation 

- match construct
  - A match construct is defined from line 2 to line 19.
  -  On line 2, the match statement takes an operator variable.
  -  On line 3, checks if the operator variable is equal to + then it displays the result of addition on line 4.
  -  On line 6, checks if the operator variable is equal to - then it displays the result of subtraction on line 7.
  -  On line 9, checks if the operator variable is equal to * then it displays the result of multiplication on line 10.
  -  On line 12, checks if the operator variable is equal to /, and the dividend is equal to 0 then it displays that it is not possible to divide 
     the number by 0 on line 14, else it displays the result of division on line 17.
  -   On line 20, checks if the operator variable is equal to % then it displays the result of modulus on line 21.
  -  On line 23, checks if the operator variable does not belong to the above then it prints “invalid” on line 23.

The following illustration explains with a=3a = 3a=3 and b=2b = 2b=2.
