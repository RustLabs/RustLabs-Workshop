# Definite Loop - For Loop

# What Is a for Loop? 
A for loop is a definite loop, meaning, the number of iterations is defined.

# Syntax 

The for loop is followed by a variable that iterates over a list of values.
The general syntax is :

# Example 
The following example uses a for loop that prints 5 numbers.

```
fn main() {
    //define a for loop 
    for i in 0..5 {
      println!("{}", i);
    }
}

```
output 
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

# Explanation 

- for loop definition
   - On line 3 a for loop is defined.
      - Variable i is an iterator variable that iterates over the range with the lower bound as 0 and the upper bound as 5. From here the body of the loop starts.
- for loop body
   - The body of the for loop is defined from line 3 to line 5
   - In each iteration:
       - On line 4, the value of the variable i is printed.
       -  The value of the variable i is incremented by 1.

- The iterator variable i traverses over the range until the upper bound is reached.

 Note: The lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound is exclusive in the range
 
 The following illustration explains this concept:

 # Enumerate
To count how many times the loop has already executed, use the .enumerate() function.

- Syntax 
The general syntax is :

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangam14/RustLabs/master/img/for_loop_enum.png)

- Example 

The example below prints the frequency of iterations and the value of variable.

```
fn main() {
  for (count, variable) in (7..10).enumerate() {
      println!("count = {}, variable = {}", count, variable);
  }
}

```
output
```
count = 0, variable = 7
count = 1, variable = 8
count = 2, variable = 9

```

# Explanation 
- enumerated for loop definition
   - On line 2 an enumerate for loop is defined.
   - The variable variable iterates over the range with the lower bound as 7 and the upper bound as 10 and a variable count which shows
      how many times the loop is iterated. From here the body of the loop starts.

- enumerated for loop body
    - On line 3, the value of count and variable is printed and then incremented by 1.
    
    
# Quiz    
    
1. What is the output of the following code?

```

fn main() {
  for i in 0..5{
     if i % 4 == 0 {
        print!("{}", i);
     }
  }
}


```

A) 04 <br> 

B) 01234 <br> 

2. What is the output of the following code?

```

fn main() {
  for (count, variable) in (7..10).enumerate() {
       if count * 2 == 4{
      println!("count = {}, variable = {}", count, variable);
       }
  }
}


```
A)

```
count = 0, variable = 7
count = 1, variable = 8
count = 2, variable = 9
```

B)
```
count = 2, variable = 9

```
