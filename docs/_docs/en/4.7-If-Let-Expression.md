# If Let Expression

# What Is an if let Expression?

if let is a conditional expression that allows pattern matching. The block of code in the construct executes if the pattern in the 
condition matches with that of scrutinee expression.

- Syntax
The if let expression begins with an if followed by a let and then a pattern having values enclosed within round brackets. Then an equal to `(=)`
followed by a scrutinee expression. Then there is a block of code enclosed within `braces{}`.Then there is also an optional else block after this.

Note: When it says matching of pattern, it means that the defined pattern has the same number of values as that of the scrutinee expression.

# Examples 

The following examples show how the different cases of if let expression can work:

```
fn main() {
    // define a scrutinee expression    
    let course = ("Rustlabs", "beginner","course");
    // pattern matches with the scrutinee expression
    if let ("Rustlabs", "beginner","course") = course {
        println!("Wrote all values in pattern to be matched with the scrutinee expression");
    } else {
        // do not execute this block
        println!("Value unmatched");
    }
}



```

output:- 

```
Wrote all values in pattern to be matched with the scrutinee expression

```

If the first value or second value matches, it can guess the third value.

```

fn main() {
    // define a scrutinee expression    
    let course = ("Rustlab", "beginner","course");
    // pattern matches with the scrutinee expression
    if let ("Rustlab", "beginner", c) = course {
        println!("Wrote first two values in pattern to be matched with the scrutinee expression : {}", c);
    } 
    else {
        // do not execute this block
        println!("Value unmatched");
    }
}


```

output :

```
Wrote first two values in pattern to be matched with the scrutinee expression : course


```

If the first value matches, it can guess the other two values.
 
 ```
 fn main() {
    // define a scrutinee expression     
    let course = ("Rustlabs", "beginner","course");
    // pattern matches with the scrutinee expression
    if let ("Rustlabs", c, d) = course {
        println!("Wrote one value in pattern to be matched with the scrutinee expression.Guessed values: {}, {}",c,d);
    } else {
        // do not execute this block
        println!("Value unmatched");
    }
}
 
 
 ```
 output:- 
 ```
 Wrote one value in pattern to be matched with the scrutinee expression.Guessed values: beginner, course
 
 
 ```
 
 # Case 2: When the Pattern is Not Matched 

In the example below, the defined pattern does not match with the scrutinee expression so the statement in the else block gets executed.

```
fn main() {
    // define a scrutinee expression     
    let course = ("Rust", "beginner");
    // pattern does not match with the scrutinee expression
    if let ("Java", c) = course {
        println!("Course is {}", c);
    } else {
        // execute this block
        println!("Value unmatched");
    }
}

```

output:- 
```
Value unmatched

```
# Case 3: When the Pattern is Replaced With `_ `

In the example below, the pattern is not defined. Rather it is replaced with an `_`. In this case, the statement within the if let block executes.

Note: A warning, ⚠️, is generated by the compiler because the Rust compiler complains that it doesn’t make sense to use` if let` with an irrefutable pattern.

```

fn main() {
    // no pattern is define
    if let _ = 10 {
        println!("irrefutable if-let pattern is always executed");
    }
}


```

output:- 

```
irrefutable if-let pattern is always executed

```

```
warning: irrefutable if-let pattern
 --> main.rs:3:5
  |
3 | /     if let _ = 10 {
4 | |         println!("irrefutable if-let pattern is always executed");
5 | |     }
  | |_____^
  |
  = note: `#[warn(irrefutable_let_patterns)]` on by default

```

# Quiz 

Test your understanding of if let Expressions in Rust.

1. What is the output of the following code?

```
fn main() {    
    let course = ("Rust", "beginner","course");
    if let ("Rust", "beginer","course") = course {
        println!("Wrote all values in pattern to be matched with the scrutinee expression");
    } else {
        println!("Value unmatched");
    }
}

```
A) Wrote all values in pattern to be matched with the scrutinee expression <br>
B) Value unmatched <br>

2. What is the output of the following code?

```
fn main() {
    // no pattern is defined
    if let _ = 10 {
        println!("irrefutable if-let pattern");
    }
}


```
A) Gives a warning with output irrefutable if-let pattern <br>
B) No warning with output irrefutable if-let pattern <br>
