# Function With Multiple Return Values

- Returning Multiple Values 
In system programming languages like C++ and C, it is only possible to return a single value or a pointer to an array from a function. However, Rust allows you to return multiple values using a tuple.

- Syntax 
The function definition for returning multiple values:

The way to return tuple from a function is to just write the tuple:

# Example

The following example makes a function `calculate_area_perimeter() `that takes a `x` and `y`( length and width of a rectangle) as a parameter to 
the function and returns a tuple `(area, perimeter)`.

```
// driver function
fn main() {
    let length = 4;
    let width = 3;
    println!("Rectangle lenth:{}", length);
    println!("Rectangle width:{}", width);
    let (area, perimeter) = calculate_area_perimeter(length, width);
    println!("Area: {}, Perimeter: {}", area, perimeter);
}
// calculate area and perimeter
fn calculate_area_perimeter(x: i32, y: i32) -> (i32, i32) {
    // calculate the area and perimeter of rectangle
    let area = x * y;
    let perimeter = 2 * (x + y);
    // return the area and perimeter of rectangle
    (area, perimeter)
}

```
output 

```
Rectangle lenth:4
Rectangle width:3
Area: 12, Perimeter: 14

```
# Explanation 

The above program comprises two functions, the user defined function `calculate_area_perimeter()` and the driver function `main()` where the function is being called.

- User defined function 
The function `calculate_area_perimeter()` is defined from line 11 to line 17.
  - On `line 13`, the area of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying parameters` x` and` y` and the result is saved in area.
  - On `line 14`, the perimeter of the rectangle is calculated by adding parameters` x` and` y `and then multiplying the result with` 2` and then, the final result is saved in perimeter.
  - On `line 16`, a tuple `(area, perimeter)` is returned.

- Driver function 
The driver function `main()` is defined from line `2` to line `9`
  - On `line 3`, a variable length is initialized with the value `4`.
  - On `line 4`, a variable width is initialized with the value 3.
  - On `line 5` and `6`, the value of length and width is displayed respectively.
  - On `line 7`, the function `calculate_area_perimeter()` is invoked which takes length and width as an argument to the function and return value of 
    the function is saved in a tuple.
